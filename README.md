# A simple unit testing library
This is a minimal library for unit testing in C. It provides functions for running tests and checking assertions.

# Usage
Just add the `testing.h` and `testing.c` files to your project, and include `testing.h` in the file that runs your unit tests. The `source` directory has a simple example.
